First established by monks of St Michael’s Mount at the creek head in 1262, Gear Mill has a long working history, standing by the tidal water of the Helford River, absorbed in its timeless rhythm.

In a beautiful valley situated beside ruins of the higher mills, the New Mill was the last mill to be built in Cornwall in 1922. Forming a natural sanctuary, Gear Mill is now a home and practice centre, hosting meditation groups, daylong and residential retreats.

Although the 30 ft waterwheel is no longer in existence, a wheel of Dharma, community and friendship turns. Visitors are warmly welcome to partake in the peace and beauty of this ancient place.

"The Valley & the Spirit never die
they form the Mystic Mother
from whose gate comes the origin of heaven and earth."
Tao Te Ching  (Ch’u Ta Kao, trans.)
