Gear Mill is a family home with dedicated shrine room serving as a space for meditation, chi kung and healing.

Adjoining the mill is a stone retreat hut, Tara Ling, welcoming guests and those wishing to do retreat in this naturally tranquil valley. 

We are glad to share our vision of a place offering space for contemplation, inspiration and renewal.
