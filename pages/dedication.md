DEDICATION AND EMPOWERMENT
OF THE GREEN TARA STONE
OF THE WOODS AND WATERS
GEAR MILL, CORNWALL
We bless this stone with the empowerment of the spirit
of Green Tara
May her mantra permeate this temple by the waters,
inspire those who practise here
and bring blessings on all those who visit her.

We bless this stone with the empowerment of the spirit
of Green Tara:
so that her creation from tears of compassion for the world
may inspire all likewise taking care of this place and all habitats
of wild creatures - world wide.

We bless this stone with the empowerment of the spirit
of Green Tara:
so that her energies may transform the ill in body
and the sick in mind
with the vast spaciousness of the light of bliss inherent
in the awareness of every moment
bringing them to a joy irrespective of any condition.

OM TARE TUTTARE TURE SWAHA
......................PHET! PHET! PHET!
